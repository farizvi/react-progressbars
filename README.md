Using vanilla JavaScript or any JavaScript library of your choice (no jQuery), implement the following (you can make it look however you like)

[Example here](http://static.optus.com.au/pei/progress-bars-demo.ogv)

[Endpoint here](http://pb-api.herokuapp.com/bars)

## Requirements
- Must read data from the endpoint
- Multiple bars
- One set of controls that can control each bar on the fly
- Can't go under 0
- Can go over limit (defined in API), but limit the bar itself and change its colour
- Display usage amount, centered
- Write tests for your code (hint: TDD strongly preferred)
- Implement a responsive solution: testing it on mobile, tablet, etc. Getting it working nicely.
- Animate the bar change, make sure it works well when you tap buttons quickly.
- Version control (git)

Once complete publish your code to github, bitbucket or other git based source control.

Bonus points for implementing "production quality" code, using practices such as:

- Setting it up as a project
- Setting up some automated tools
- Linting, code quality, etc
- JavaScript/CSS minification, packaging, etc
- Using a CSS preprocessor like SASS/SCSS
- Styling it to a production quality level
